#Managing text files
# We can only record strings in text files.

#a='tsla'
#f1=open('demo1.txt','w')
#f1.write(a)
#f1.close()

#f2=open('demo1.txt','r')
#d=f2.read()
#print(d)
#f2.close()

# There are multiple modes -
# r mode - Read mode
# w mode - Erase the previous data and write new data
# a mode - append mode - It will add data but not delete previous one

#Sometimes you need to take files from other directories; in this case, put entire address of the file, including folder name.

#You have to specify complete address of file - User, Desktop,,Terminal, directory
